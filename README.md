Auto Incrementing MText Object

This Auto Incrementing MText Object is an AutoLISP program for AutoCAD that allows you to place MText objects with an automatically incremented integer at the end of the text. The integer value is based on the last MText object selected and incremented by one for each subsequent placement.
Usage

    Load the AutoLISP program in AutoCAD.
    Run the IncText command.
    Select an existing MText object to retrieve the text and the starting integer value.
    Specify the insertion point for the new MText object.
    The program will automatically increment the integer value by one and append it to the text.
    The new MText object will be placed at the specified insertion point.
